# Abstract

**[REWRITE NEEDED]** * **Context:** Rodents/shrews are key reservoirs. 
* **Problem:** We don't know if observed host patterns are real or artifacts of "streetlight" surveillance. 
* **Approach:** Systematic review (1977-2025) + Data Synthesis + **[NEW]** Macroecological Trait Integration. 
* **Bias Result:** We quantify massive taxonomic/geographic bias (Palearctic/Synanthropic focus). 
* **Ecological Result [NEW]:** After statistically correcting for these biases using Dyadic GLMMs, we reveal the fundamental axes of reservoir suitability. *[Insert finding here: e.g., "Fast life-history pace and high metabolic turnover significantly predict reservoir status, independent of sampling effort."]* * **Evolutionary Context [NEW]:** Co-phylogenetic analysis reveals [Congruence/Incongruence], suggesting [Host Switching/Co-speciation] is the dominant driver of viral diversity.
* **Conclusion:** Correcting anthropogenic bias reveals that reservoir status is a predictable biological trait, not just a stochastic occurrence.

# Introduction

## The Global Reservoir Problem **[KEEP]**
* Broad context of ArHa viruses.
* The shift from "one-host-one-virus" to complex multi-host systems.

## The Surveillance Barrier **[KEEP/REFINE]**
* The "Surveillance Landscape" concept.
* The "Streetlight Effect" (bias towards knowns/synanthropes).
* *Argument:* We cannot understand the ecology of these viruses if we are only looking at *Rattus* and *Mus* in high-income countries.

## Theoretical Framework: Why Ecology Matters **[NEW SECTION]**
* **[WRITE THIS]:** Introduce the macroecological hypotheses we want to test once bias is removed.
    * **The "Fast Life-History" Hypothesis:** Theory suggests "fast-lived" (r-selected) species invest less in immunity and tolerate infections better.
    * **Energetic Constraints:** Does high metabolic rate correlate with viral competency?
    * **Ecological Opportunity:** Do generalists (diet/habitat) encounter more viruses?

## Study Aims **[UPDATE]**
1. Synthesize global data to quantify the "anthropogenic filter" (biases).
2. **[NEW]** Leverage this data to test if Life History, Energetics, and Synanthropy predict host status *after* stripping away the surveillance bias.
3. **[NEW]** Assess the evolutionary congruence between hosts and viruses to determine the role of host-switching vs. co-divergence (Placeholder for R).

# Methods

## Systematic Review & Data Harmonisation **[KEEP]**
* (Your existing text on PubMed/WoS search, MDD taxonomy, etc.).

## Integration of Macroecological Traits **[NEW METHODS]**
* **[Action]:** Describe merging `harmonised_species` with COMBINE / Amniote / PanTHERIA / EltonTraits.
* **[Action]:** PCA on life-history traits ("Pace of Life" axis).

## Quantifying Surveillance Bias **[CONDENSE]**
* Keep GAMs (sampling effort). 
* Keep Geographic/Temporal descriptive methods (shortened).

## Modeling Reservoir Probability (Dyadic GLMMs) **[EXPAND]**
* **[Action]:** Update model specification.
* **Definitions [UPDATE]:** Explicitly define the response variables: 
    * *Current Infection:* Evidence of active virus (PCR/Culture/Seq).
    * *Prior Exposure:* Evidence of antibodies (Serology).
* *Hypothesis Variables:* `Life_History_PC1`, `Metabolic_Rate`, `Diet_Breadth`, `Synanthropy_Status`.
* *Control Variable:* `log_sampling_effort`.
* *Random Effects:* `(1|Host_Species) + (1|Pathogen_Species)`. 
* *Phylogenetic Control [SUGGESTION]:* Consider adding a phylogenetic covariance matrix `(1|gr(phylo, cov = A))` to control for host relatedness in the trait analysis.

## Evolutionary Analysis **[NEW - Placeholder for R]**
* **[Action]:** Describe methods for viral taxonomy cleaning.
* **[Action]:** Describe Co-phylogenetic methods (e.g., ParaFit, PACo, or simple Tanglegrams) to test for congruence between host and viral trees.

# Results

## The Anthropogenic Filter: Quantified Biases **[CONDENSE]**
* **[KEEP]:** Palearctic/Nearctic bias.
* **[KEEP]:** Synanthropy driving *sampling effort*.

## Macroecological Drivers of Reservoir Status **[NEW & MAJOR SECTION]**
* *Centerpiece for NEE.*
* **[Action]:** Report Dyadic GLMM results.
    * **Sampling Effort:** Confirm it explains the majority of variance.
    * **Life History:** Report OR for "Fast" species.
    * **Synanthropy:** Does it persist after adding life history? 
    * **Current vs. Prior:** Do the drivers differ? (e.g., Maybe *Prior Exposure* is driven by age/longevity, while *Current Infection* is driven by acute susceptibility).

## Evolutionary Congruence **[NEW - Placeholder for R]**
* **[Action]:** Report results of the co-phylogeny. 
* *Expected:* "While broad congruence exists at the Family level, frequent host-switching is evident at the genus/species level..." (or whatever the data shows).

## The Genetic Data Gap **[KEEP]**
* Disconnect between field sampling and GenBank availability.

# Discussion

## De-biasing Reveals Biology **[NEW ANGLE]**
* "Raw surveillance data is a map of human activity. Correcting for this reveals that host competence is not random."

## The "Fast-Lived" Reservoir **[NEW INTERPRETATION]**
* Interpret Life History findings (Tolerance vs. Resistance).
* Contrast with Bat/Filovirus literature if results differ.

## Evolutionary Constraints vs. Ecological Opportunity **[INTEGRATION]**
* Integrate **R's** findings: Is the reservoir status driven more by deep evolutionary history (co-phylogeny) or by current ecological traits (life history)?

## A Roadmap for Predictive Surveillance **[KEEP/REFINE]**
* Sample **"Fast-lived"** species currently ignored.
* Sample **Non-synanthropic** species in the Palearctic/Nearctic.
* Prioritize **Genetic sequencing**.
